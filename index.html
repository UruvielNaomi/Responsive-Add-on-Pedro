      <h5>Why</h5>
      <h4>Why is Pedro Pascal my favourite actor?</h4>
      <p>Pedro Pascal is currently my favourite actor because besides being a talented actor starring in numerous different films and shows, he also has an amazing sense of humour. He has an amazing style, often wearing creative and original outfits on the red carpet. He uses his platform to raise awareness and funds for various causes. He is an LGBTQI ally. And he shows his love and appreciation for his fans. Fans call him Papi Pascal for a reason.</p>

            <h6>What I like about..?</h6>
            <p>I grew up with everything Star Wars, so I was already excited about this before it came out. Because he always wears a helmet I didn’t even realise it was Pedro until well into season 2.</p>

            <h6>What I like about..?</h6>
            <p>It is a warm, funny, and touching comedy that is also very meta about the craft of acting, the life of an actor, and filmmaking.  Pedro can really show off his comedic side in this film.</p>

            <p class="release-date">August 8, 2015</p>
  
            <h6>What I like about..?</h6>
            <p> Because the show is based on real life events, the juxtaposition between real life visuals and the fictional, works well. It also has amazing screenplay.</p>
